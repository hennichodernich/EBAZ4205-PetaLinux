    "The AI engine with PL example demonstrates how to use AI engine for scalar\n",
    "computation, and use PL for data movement. In this example, to run the matrix\n",
    "multiplication on AI engine, we use standard matrix multiplication algorithm.\n",
    "The user can change the matrix size and the number of cores utilized at\n",
    "compile-time. The expected matrix size must be a multiple of 50 (number of\n",
    "cores used) with the minimum and maximum value as 100x100 and 1200x1200\n",
    "respectively. Please note that this example is intended to be a proof of\n",
    "concept only. There can be other ways of implementation, which can leverage\n",
    "more of the AIE resource and hence can result in better performance figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider two matrices A and B, the product of the two, i.e. AxB, is a linear\n",
    "combination of the columns of A by matrix B. This means that the elements\n",
    "in a row (i) of A are multiplied with the elements in a column of B (j) and are\n",
    "summed up to give the corresponding single element in the matrix AxB at i, j.\n",
    "This means that if A is an n x m matrix and B is an m x p matrix, then the\n",
    "corresponding product AxB would have dimensions n x p. Note how the number of\n",
    "columns of A equals the number of rows in B to make the matrix multiplication\n",
    "possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data movement\n",
    "\n",
    "The application uses the PLIO attribute to make external memory-mapped\n",
    "connections to or from global memory. These connections are created between\n",
    "AIE kernel and the logical global memory port of the hardware platform design\n",
    "via AXI-Multichannel Direct Memory Access IP in the fabric. In this design,\n",
    "the buffer descriptors are programmed in the AXI-MCDMA IP to initiate AIE to DDR\n",
    "read and write transactions in the PS program. The burst-length of the\n",
    "memory-mapped transaction is 64-bit,and AXI-MCDMAs use physical memory\n",
    "addressing read/write data from global memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"pics/aie_app_data_movement.png\">\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "To compute matrix multiplication on AIE, matrix A is sliced horizontally and\n",
    "distributed equally among all the core utilized through the AXI-Stream network.\n",
    "Matrix B is transposed and feed to the first core in the design element by\n",
    "element. The first core shares the input matrix B with the next core through the\n",
    "AXI-Stream connection. As the output received from the cores is in z-order\n",
    "fashion, hence a re-ordering of the output matrix is expected.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Compilation Flow\n",

    "- ELF loading\n",
    "\tDirect call to AI Engine driver to load ELF file\n",
    "\n",
    "The high-level tool, Vitis, can generates aie_control_xrt.cpp which is\n",
    "cross-compiled to run on the target. The compiled application loads the\n",
    "generated AIE ELFs and CDOs (packeged into XCLBIN) to the corresponding tile\n",
    "through load XCLBIN API. The AI Engine configuration can also be done by calling\n",
    "AI Engine driver APIs directly without loading XCLBIN.\n",

    "(tool generated) run time library, libadf_api_xrt.a. AIE userspace drivers\n",
